        <div class="description">
            <p> The feed rate is the speed for "feed" movements ( G1/G2/G3 ) during which the tool is active, as opposed to "seek" movements ( G0 ) during which the tool is inactive </p>
            <p> This value is the default speed, that will be used for feed moves at boot time, until a speed is actually specificed by a <kbd>F</kbd> parameter </p>
            <p>In simple terms,  the "feed rate" is the speed the cutting tool is moving while performing an actuall cutting of the material at a starting preset rate until an actuall feed rate is specified.</p>

            <p>In simpler trms, this is the speed at which the cutting head moves into position before performing an actual cutting operation, at a default spped until an actual speed is specified in the design file.</p>

            <p> The alpha actuator is typically the X axis on cartesian machines (like in a gantry setup), and the first tower on delta machines. By default it controls the M1 motor driver. </p>

            <p> The best way to make sure this value is accurate is to create a design file with a line of known length, make the cut, then measure with a micrometer to verify the distance.

            <p>If unsure of the type of machine you have, cartesian is the standard x,y basic CNC setup. 90% plus of machines are of this style.
