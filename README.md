`git submodule update`  
so the submodules are initialized ( duh ! )


## using gulp

You need to have Node.js (Node) installed onto your computer before you can install Gulp.  
If you do not have Node installed already, you can get it by [downloading the package installer from Node's website.](https://nodejs.org/)   

Install `gulp` using:  
`npm install --global gulp`  
this command will install gulp system wide. You should now be able to hit gulp in your command line.

Then use:  
`npm install`  
this command will read all the dependencies that were defined in the `package.json` file and automatically installs them for you.

To build use `gulp` (default task) or `gulp demo` for version with mocked data
